# Detecting Financial Fraud Using Machine Learning: A Predictive Approach to Safeguard Digital Transactions

# Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning–based fraud detection system
that can accurately identify whether a financial transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.
Using anonymized real-world credit card transaction data, the project aims to:
• Analyze patterns in large-scale financial transactions
• Handle extreme class imbalance (only ~0.17% fraud cases)
• Build and compare predictive models such as Logistic Regression, LDA, Decision
Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and others
• Evaluate models using metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision, recall, and
confusion matrix, to ensure low false-negative rates
• Support real-time fraud detection efforts in financial institutions by identifying
suspicious activities early

By the end of this project, learners will understand how to apply supervised learning to high- stakes, imbalanced classification problems, and how to optimize models for business-critical outcomes rather than generic accuracy.
